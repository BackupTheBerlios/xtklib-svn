General Information
===================

The "Cross Platform Toolkit Library"(xtklib) is a C++ based framework 
for highly object-oriented cross-platform programming. In particular, 
the library provides a full abstraction layer between its API and 
the main services offered by the underlying operating system(Thread, 
processes,GUI,Filesystem,etc.) plus a set of generic utilities 
(Strings,Data structures,etc.).

Unlike other famous libraries, xtklib makes full use of all features 
of C++ like RTTI, Templates, Exceptions thus obtaining a strongly 
object-oriented design with a Java-like sensation. The library is 
composed by two main modules: "Base" and "Widgets". The target 
operating systems are Windows and Unix(Linux and BSD in primis) 
with a plan to move also towards other systems.
